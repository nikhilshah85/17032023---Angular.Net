2. npm install @angular\cli -g
3. ng new firstapp
	it will ask for routing - say N
	use CSS for styling
4. ng serve (this will run the app)
5. open with VS Code

6. In the new project, you will find a folder src - this is where development happens

src folder has a default/master component - app

Angular development is all about Component Development
We get a default component - App - this is master component and other components are placed inside this component


Component = HTML + CSS + TS (optionaly a test case file as well)
